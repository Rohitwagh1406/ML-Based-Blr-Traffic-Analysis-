# Traffic Analysis Project

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict traffic volume, classify congestion levels, and detect incidents in Bangalore. The dataset contains traffic-related features like traffic volume, congestion, speed, and road capacity.

## Project Overview
- **Traffic Volume Prediction**: Predict traffic volume using regression models.
- **Congestion Level Classification**: Classify congestion levels (Low, Medium, High).
- **Incident Detection**: Detect incidents using classification models.

## Files
- `traffic_analysis_project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire project.
- `app.py`: Flask API for real-time traffic prediction.
- `requirements.txt`: Required Python packages for the project.
- `project_report.txt`: A detailed project report explaining the methodology and results.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Flask API:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Traffic Volume Prediction**: Achieved an **RÂ² score of 0.99999**.
- **Congestion Level Classification**: Achieved **94% accuracy**.
- **Incident Detection**: Model needs improvement with **32% accuracy**.

## Future Work
- Improve **Incident Detection**.
- Implement **Real-Time Data Integration**.
